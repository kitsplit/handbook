# Welcome to KitSplit

Hey! Welcome to the KitSplit team, we’re so excited to have you with us. We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how KitSplit works and how we work together.

At KitSplit, we’re trying to build an inclusive and value-driven organization. If you have any questions about why we do things a certain way, or have a suggestion about how we can do anything better, please let us know (or just write comments in the documents -- you should already have comment access to everything in the KitSplit handbook!).  

## Your First Day

Hopefully by the time you’re actually starting at KitSplit, you’ve already finished filling out the paperwork. Today is all about getting you set up and making sure you’re ready to go.

Take some time to meet everyone you’ll be working with, and set things up the way you like them. We'll also get you set up with some of the services we use, like Slack and Intercom. First days are hard and mostly we want you to be getting comfortable today.

We’ll also do a team meal today so that we have a little dedicated time to talk with everyone. If you have any food preferences or restrictions that we should consider in choosing a lunch spot, let us know.

Also, brainstorm with your manager about something you can publish live! If you’re a designer, that could be a color change for a button. If you’re a developer, it might be fixing a missing semicolon. It could be a tweet from the KitSplit account or a blog post, a support response or an infographic. Whatever you’ll be doing at KitSplit, we'd love for you to ship something small today.

We want you to stick around. Your successes here will be your team’s successes, and your team’s successes will be yours. We want you to build a career here, so don’t feel any pressure to cram everything into today -- you’ll have plenty of time to get things right.


## The KitSplit Team, Hours, and Office

KitSplit operates as a single team where everyone is working towards company-level goals. Since we’re still small, there’s not too much overhead in keeping up with everyone. There are still engineering-specific meetings, and marketing conversations that happen separately. But when we set our goals, we all think directly about how we contribute to the company goals. You’ll get to work with everyone at KitSplit in some capacity, and dip your fingers into all different kinds of thinking.

We believe that if you have too much on your plate, then you can only see what’s right in front of you. You need space and time to think about the future and plan ahead. If we give ourselves room to breathe and think and live, we’re capable of much broader thinking. To achieve that, we try to create a culture that’s not based on scarcity.

You should expect a typical workweek at KitSplit to be 45-55 hours. Most people come in around 10, and leave around 7. We value decompressing and taking a break on nights and weekends, but as needed, we sometimes put in a few hours or more on nights and weekends to finish projects. We also occaisionally host or go to events at night. This is to give you a sense of what’s normal here, but you should work the hours that are healthy and sustainable for you. If you'd like to shift your hours earlier, let us know and we can work with you to do that. 

We try to make the office atmosphere welcoming and respectful for people of all different backgrounds. This is an ongoing process of negotiating and compromising as we share space, and depends on good communication. If there are specific things you like or want to change, let us know. We’re always getting better :)

## The Future

KitSplit is a small company that is changing and improving rapidly. Today is about welcoming you and helping you join our team, but soon we’ll need your help growing and learning. KitSplit will be a very different company a year from today, and it’s hard to imagine what it will be like in 5 or 10. You will have a hand in building that company, and we’re so excited to have your help.
